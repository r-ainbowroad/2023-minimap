## Diplomatic contacts
Please join our Discord server: https://discord.gg/bronyplace

There is a diplomacy chat along with a forum for diplomats and allies. Ping the @Diplomatic Liaison
role - you should get the @Representative role as an ally and diplomatic contact.

## Template processing queue
Check [this GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/r-ainbowroad/projects/4) for status

## Getting our art
We offer an osu!/Endu-style template at https://ponyplace.z19.web.core.windows.net/mlp/endu_template.json which only contains art from our faction.
We make updates to this template alongside our internal formats as we push changes out.

Please contact our diplomats if you need specific pieces of art or have a different request. You may be able to self-serve by ruffling around [in GitHub](https://github.com/r-ainbowroad/2023-minimap/tree/main/templates/mlp).

## Adding new art
Before you contact a diplomat, please have your art ready. There are two options for this.

### Templates
We are capable of accepting [osu!/Endu-style templates](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/blob/main/osuplace2023.json) but do not follow the whitelist references, nor do we support animation.

Updates to your art will get picked up automatically several times an hour. We appreciate notice of big changes, and you can ask us to force refresh if a change needs to happen faster.

### Images
Be aware that if you take this option, you are joining the herd and/or being adopted by the herd. The images are integrated directly into our system and updates need to go through our template processing queue.

We are also capable of accepting 1:1 / "one pixel per pixel" .png images with transparency and the appropriate coordinates of the upper left corner of the image.

**NOTE** We do not accept images that are not 1:1, or are not transparent. We ask that your images only contain colors that the canvas currently supports.

If you need to update your image, please contact the diplomats to get the updated version into our template processing queue.
